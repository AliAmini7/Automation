# Automation
In this repository I am placing the codes I use to automate my daily tasks as an educator and a resident fellow in a university dormitory.


# Workflow
In the midst of COVID-19 situation, it is mandatory for the students to declare their temperature two times a day.

In order to deepen this behaviour, we have conditioned a welfare supper with past declaration two out of three. 

The contained KNIME workflow reads the temperature declaration in the past three periods and an input from google forms on serving time
and type of prata. The output is a data set of only those who are eligible, the time they need to come to the prata booth and their choices.
